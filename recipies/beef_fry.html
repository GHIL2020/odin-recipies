    <h3>Stir-fry</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup of cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of peanut oil</li>
        <li>1/4 white onion</li>
        <li>1 bell pepper</li>
        <li>4 chinese dried chili peppers</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic</li>
        <li>Roasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Marinate the beef</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the egg in a medium sized bowl. Add the sliced beef, vegetable oil, and salt. Mix well and let marinate for 15 to 20 minutes while preparing the other ingredients.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Mix the sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine everything for the sauce in a big bowl and mix well.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Stir fry</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>When youâ€™re ready to cook, drain the extra liquid from the bowl of beef. Add the cornstarch. Stir to coat the beef, until it forms an uneven coating with a little dry cornstarch left unattached.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet (or a cast iron pan) over medium high heat until hot. Add the beef and spread into a single layer in the skillet. Separate the beef pieces with a pair of tongs or chopsticks.</li>
        <li>Cook without touching the beef for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the bottom turns golden. Flip to brown the other side, 1 to 2 misnutes. Transfer the beef to a big plate and remove the pan from the stove. Let cool for 2 to 3 minutes</li>
        <li>Place the pan back onto the stove and turn to medium heat. You should still have 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil in the pan. If not, add more.</li>
        <li>Add the onion, pepper, and dried chili pepper. Cook and stir for 1 minut</li>
        <li>Add the ginger and garlic. Stir a few times to release the fragrance.</li>
        <li>Stir the sauce again to dissolve the cornstarch completely. Pour into the pan. Stir and cook until it thickens a bit.</li>
        <li>Add back the beef pieces. Stir to coat beef with sauce.</li>
        <li>Transfer everything to a plate immediately and garnish with roasted sesame seeds, if using.</li>
        <li>Serve hot over steamed rice as a main dish.</li>
    </ol>
